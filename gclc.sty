% The comamnd \gclcline is partly based on emlines.sty  
% (by Georg Horn/Eberhard Mattes).
% If several figures should be placed on one page, then before
% each one, there should be one \gclcpicture command with the 
% number of the picture.
% \input{sample1.pic}
% \gclcpicture{1}
% \input{sample2.pic}
% This is so because DVI drivers can (in an appropriate mode)
% address only a limited number of points each of which has its 
% own index. These indices usually go from 1 to 32767. If there are several
% pictures, each of their point should have an index which is unique;
% indices of points in different pictures thus differ in the first
% digit. If pictures have thousands of points, this approach can fail
% (for instance, if there are three pictures each with 3000 points)
% There is also another solutions for this problem -- GCLC programs
% can create pictures with indices of points starting with a given 
% number (see GCLC manuals for more details).
