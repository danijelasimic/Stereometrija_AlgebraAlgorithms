\section{Introduction}
For over two millennia, geometry has been one of the major topics in
education all around the world. Since Euclid's ,,Elements'', geometry
has been a central field for introducing students to deduction and
rigorous argumentation. 

In recent years, computers and technology have been intensively used
to change how geometry is taught. \emph{Dynamic geometry systems} such
as GeoGebra\footnote{\url{https://www.geogebra.org/}},
Cinderella\footnote{\url{https://www.cinderella.de/tiki-index.php}},
Geometer's Sketchpad\footnote{\url{http://www.dynamicgeometry.com/}},
Cabri\footnote{\url{http://www.cabri.com/}},
Eukleides\footnote{\url{http://www.eukleides.org/}} are now regularly
used in all levels of education. Students use such systems to perform
geometric constructions, and obtain diagrams that can be distored by
moving free points. Such dynamic diagrams are better than static
images, since moving free points can shed additional light to the
problem, reveal degenerate cases, help student to determine if
something is true only if some special order of points is considered
(for example, some property could be true only if a point is between
some other two points, and be false if that is not the case, some
property could be true only for accute, and not for obtuse angles
etc.).

By doing extensive distortion of diagrams by moving free points,
student can be pretty sure if a property is generaly true (i.e., true
in all, but a small number of degenerate cases), but still, that
cannot be considered to be a proof, and is error prone. Therefore,
recently dynamic geometry systems have been extended by automated
reasoning systems, that can automatically prove statements about
constructed objects (\cite{geogebra-provers}). Such theorem provers
are usually algebraic (they perform calculations on symbolic
coordinates of geometric objects).

Most research in both dynamic geometry systems and automated theorem
proving in geometry has been devoted only to two-dimensional Euclidean
geometry (plane geometry). However, in our view, application of
dynamic geometry software for three-dimension space (solid geometry)
is even more important since it is often hard to determine geometric
properties of spatial objects only by observing diagrams, since three
dimensional space is presented only by its two-dimensional projections
and thus measures of distances and angles are not directly
preserved. It is much easier to see that two lines in plane geometry
are perpendicular, then to see if two intersecting lines in space are
perpendicular, even if the viewpoint is moved and the object is
rotated and looked from many angles.

Some geometry systems developed support for three-dimensional
constructions. The new version of GeoGeobra have developed support for
dynamic three dimension
graphics\footnote{\url{https://wiki.geogebra.org/en/3D_Graphics_View}}. It
is possible to create and dynamically change three dimension objects
such as points, lines, polygons and spheres, as well as graphics of
two-variable functions that are surfaces in 3d. However, up to the
best of our knowledge, this system does not yet support proving
statements about three-dimension objects. Both Cinderella and
Cindy3D\footnote{\url{http://gagern.github.io/Cindy3D/}} have
extensions for drawing three dimension objects using commands and
formulas describing them. Although there have been some limited
attempts to apply algebraic theorem proving methods to
three-dimensional Euclidean space geometry (solid geometry), we are
not aware that there are thorough descriptions of these methods, nor
publicly available implementations of automated provers for solid
geometry.

Having this in mind, this work tries to bridge several gaps that we
feel are present in current state-of-the-art in the field of automatic
proving in solid geometry.
\begin{enumerate}
\item In this paper we examine and compare several ways of applying
  algebraic theorem provers based on Gr\"obner bases and Wu's method
  to solid geometry problems.

\item We describe integration of algebraic theorem provers with
  dynamic geometry systems for solid geometry.

\item We provide an implementation of one dynamic geometry system for
  solid geometry, capable of proving statements about the properties
  of constructed objects.

\item We also analyze a corpus of problems from solid geometry and
  evaluate methods to those problems.

\item We discuss challenges and possible applications in the field of
  geometry education.

\paragraph{Automated reasoning in plane geometry}
Automated theorem proving has a history more than fifty years
long. Most successful automated theorem methods are those for proving
in geometry. Automated theorem provers for geometry are based either
on the synthetic approach or on the algebraic approach (based on some
coordinates).

Major breakthrough in the algebraic approach was made by
(\cite{wu}). The geometric construction and the statement are first
encoded as a set of polynomial equalities over their coordinates, and
then the Wu's method uses algebraic techniques for dealing with these
polynomials. In his paper (\cite{ritt}) described similar ideas as Wu,
so nowdays this method is usually called Ritt-Wu's method. Many
theorems were successfully proved using this method
(\cite{chou1984}). The success of the Wu's method motivated other
researcher to develop new methods, and one of the most prominent is
the Gr\"obner basis method based on Buchberger's algorithm
(\cite{buchberger}). Similar to Wu's method, the Gr\"obner basis also
reasons representation in form of a set of polynomial
equalities. There are many implementations of these algorithms and
some are in commercial software (e.g. Matllab, Mathematica or
Maple). However, both methods produce only yes or no answers instead
of human understandable proofs and cannot deal with width inequality
(therefore cannot reason about the order of points).

Several coordinate-free methods that do not use coordinate
representation of points are developed in the 1980's. The reason for
their development was in the idea that it is possible to develop
prover that would produce human readable proofs. Most prominent are
the area method (\cite{area}) and the full angle method
(\cite{fullangle}), and those methods are usually referred to as
semi--algebraic, since they involve reasoning over some special
geometric quantities (e.g., signed area or Pythagora's
differences). These methods are usually not as efficient as algebraic
methods and have smaller scope than algebraic methods.

One of the first synthetic provers, that uses method of resolution,
was developed by (\cite{gelertner}) whose idea was to develop the
proof that is similar to human proof. He successfully proved many
problems taken from high--school textbooks. In modern times, synthetic
provers are usually based on coherent (synthetic) logic --- a special
fragment of first order logic convenient for geometric reasoning. For
example, the prover ArgoCLP (\cite{sana}) uses coherent logic to
produce human readable proofs.

\paragraph{Automated reasoning in solid geometry}
Chou et al. presented volume method (\cite{volumemethod}). It is a
semi-algebraic method that is extension of the area method for solid
geometry. Hypotheses can be described constructively and conclusions
are polynomial equations of several geometry quantities, such as
volumes, ratios of line segments, ratios of areas, and Pythagoras
differences. The key idea of the method is to eliminate points from
the conclusion of a geometry statement using several basic
propositions about volumes.

Shao et al. used solid geometry problems from Mathematical Olympiad
problems and exercises to evaluate different geometry provers
(\cite{shao2016challenging}). In the paper are presented three
different examples. For each example are given polynomials (derived
using pen--and--paper) representing solid geometry conjecture. Using
these examples is demonstrated that algebraic methods can be used for
proving in solid geometry. For each example they used three different
methods, characteristic set method (\cite{wu}), Gr\"obner basis method
(\cite{buchberger}) and vector algebra method (\cite{lord1985method}).
These methods are compered and they give conclusion that vector
algebra method gives better geometry proof but derived equations can
be long and difficult for manipulation and calculation. They tested
these methods on 97 problems, but they derived all polynomials using
pen--and--paper. Although Maple is used for Gr\"obner basis method,
they do not present any automatic algebraization of solid geometric
statements, e.g. how to transform geometric statements into
polynomials.

Loch and Pl{\"u}mer analyzed how algebraic methods could be applied
for reducing constraints for 3D buildings
(\cite{loch2009geometric}). Focus was on analyzing existing city
models and constraints such as parallelity, orthogonality and
symmetry. The goal was to determine which constraints are subsumed by
others and therefore can be omitted.  They presented polynomial
equations for parallelism, orthogonality and incidence for point and
plane and Wu's characteristic set method was successfully
applied. Since polynomials were quite complex the key was to reduce
the number of variables and to use multilinear polynomials rather than
quadratic. They also made a prototype of the system where user can
manipulate with constraints.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Algebraization of geometry relations}
We shall assume that geometry problems are given in terms of relations
between the geometric object involved (points, lines, planes, circles,
\ldots). Each theorem under consideration is given in form of an
implication, and both hypothesis and conclusions are given as one or
more geometric relations. In some cases, the properties of constructed
geometric objects should be proved. The construction is usually
specified by a series of construction steps, and each construction
step is a function that builds new geometric objects out of the
existing ones. However, the properties of the new object can usually
be specified in terms of one or more relations, so without losing
generality, it can be assumed that we are dealing only with relations.

The standard algebraization procedure introduces fresh symbolic
variables for point coordinates and introduces (polynomial) equations
that characterize every relation between objected observed.

Each object can be given independently by adding its arbitrary
parameters or it can be given using relationship with other, already
introduced objects. In the second case, for each new object both the
parameters and the polynomials that represent relationship between new
object and other objects in the construction are
introduced. Polynomials contain parameters of all objects in the
construction rule and analytic identities. All polynomials are
recorded in construction set which is later used in GeoProver.

Beside construction rules, there are statement rules, rules used to
express some condition that can be check using GeoProver. For each of
these conditions are created polynomials which are recorded in the
statement set. Although in most of the cases, there is only one
statement polynomial, there were couple statement that generated more
than one. As mentioned earlier, GeoProver can only have one statement
rule. However, this not pose a problem, since for each polynomial in
the statement set GeoProver was applied (always using the same
construction set). The statement is considered to be true only if
GeoProver returned true for all polynomials in the statement set.

For the purpose of the further text we are going to assume that we
have all the necessary data for each construction or statement rule
(our system collects this data, but we are not going to explain
technical side of the system since we fill this is not the scope of
this paper). This means that we have all the parameters of already
given objects.

\subsection{Algebraic methods}

Algebraic methods in geometry are well described in literature
(\cite{wu, buchberger}). In this section we give a brief account on
algebraic methods in geometry, in order to explain some relevant steps
needed in algebraization of solid objects.

Algebraization introduces variables $v_i$ that denote coordinates of
free and constructed points. Geometric relations between points are
described by polynomial equations of the form $p_1(v_1, \ldots, v_n) =
p_2(v_1, \ldots, v_n)$, that are trivially transformed to the form
$p(v_1, \ldots, v_n) = 0$. 

If polynomials representing relations between objects given by the
construction and theorem assumptions are denoted by $f_i$, $i = 1,
\ldots, k$, and if the polynomials representing relations to be proved
are denoted by $g_j$, $j = 1, \ldots, l$, then proving reduces to
checking if for each $g_j$ it holds that
$$\forall v_1, \ldots, v_n \in \mathbb{R}. \bigwedge_{i = 1}^{k}
f_i(v_1, \ldots, v_n) = 0 \Longrightarrow g_j(v_1, \ldots, v_n) = 0.$$
Polynomials $f_i$ are sometimes called \emph{construction polynomials}
and $g_j$ are called \emph{statement polynomials}.

Once the geometric theorem has been algebrized, it is possible to
apply algebraic theorem proving methods.  As Tarski suggested, proving
geometric properties can be done using quantifier elimination
procedure for the reals, but this approach is inefficient and proving
nontrivial geometric properties would take too long. But, there is
another approach. The main insight, given by Wu Wen-ts\"un in 1978, is
that remarkably many geometrical theorems, when formulated as
universal algebraic statements in terms of coordinates, are also true
for all complex values of the “coordinates”. However, a care should be
taken, since, in some cases, the condition holds for $\mathbb{R}$, but
not for $\mathbb{C}$, and in these cases methods fail due to
counterexamples in $\mathbb{C}$. Statements to be proved are of
following form:
$$\forall v_1, \ldots, v_n \in \mathbb{C}. \bigwedge_{i = 1}^{k} f_i(v_1, \ldots, v_n) = 0 \Longrightarrow g_j(v_1, \ldots, v_n) = 0.$$

This is true when $g_j$ belongs to the radical ideal $I = \langle f_1,
\ldots, f_k \rangle$, i.e. when exists an integer $r$ and polynomials
$h_1, \ldots, h_k$ such that $g_j^r = \sum_{i=1}^k h_if_i$.

The two most significant algebraic methods that use a kind of
Euclidean division to check the validity of an observed conjecture are
Buchberger's method consists in transforming the generating set into a
Gr\"obner basis and the Wu's method.

\paragraph{Wu's method}

The first step of simple Wu's method (\cite{wu}) uses the
pseudo--division operation to transform the polynomial system to
triangular form, i.e. to a system of equations where each successive
equation introduces exactly one dependent variable. After that, the
final reminder is calculated by pseudo dividing polynomial for the
statements to be proved by each polynomial from triangular system.
Summarizing, Wu's method, in its simplest form, allows to compute some
polynomials $c, h_1, \ldots, h_k$ and $r$ such that
$$cg_j = \sum_{i=1}^{k}h_if_i + r$$ If the final remainder $r$ is
equal to zero, then the conjecture is considered to be proved. This
simple method of Wu is not complete (in algebraic sense) and
sometimes the result of applying method is indecisive, i.e. the
theorem can't be proved nor disproved. A more complex and complete
version of the method uses ascending chains which are considered in
the Ritt-Wu principle (\cite{ritt}).

\paragraph{Gr\"obner basis method}

$G$ is gr\"obner basis for ideal $I = \langle f_1, \ldots, f_k
\rangle$ if and only if multivariate division any polynomial belonging
to ideal $I$ with $G$ gives $0$. This means that proving given
conjecture consists of two steps. The first is determining the
Gr\"obner basis for polynomials describing relation between objects,
$f_1, \ldots, f_k$. The second step is multivariate division of
polynomial describing relation to be proved, $g_j$ with $G$. If the
result of division is $0$ then statement is proved, otherwise is
disproved.

For calculating Gr\"obner basis is used Buchberger's algorithm
(\cite{buchberger}) witch transforms a given set of polynomials into a
Gr\"obner basis with respect to some monomial order using B-reduction.

\subsection{Implementations of algebraic methods}

For testing results of applied agrebaization we used three systems --
GeoProver that uses simple Wu's method (\cite{geoprover}),
Mathematica\footnote{\url{https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/}} with
implemented Gr\"obner basis method and
Maple\footnote{\url{https://www.maplesoft.com/products/maple/}} with
implemented Wu's method (\cite{wsolve}). Shortly, all systems are
going to be presented here.

\paragraph{GeoProver}

GeoProver is open source software implemented in Java providing
support for algebraic theorem proving using Wu's method. It consists
of two main modules: one provides support for algebraic methods and
the other is a set of APIs from different geometric applications and
formats to the prover.

GeoProver produces detailed reports with steps that are taken in
proving process: transformation of input geometric problem to
algebraic form, invoking a specified algebraic-based theorem prover,
and presenting the result with time and space spent to prove the
theorem and with a list of NDG conditions obtained during proving
process, transformed to a readable, geometry form.

One of the main purposes of this Java implementation is integration
with various dynamic geometry tools (including GeoGebra) that
currently don't have support for proving geometry theorems. The
architecture of GeoProver enables easy integration with other systems
for interactive geometry and can be simply modified to accept various
input formats for conjectures.

\paragraph{Gr\"obner bases in Mathematica}

Mathematica is commercial software designed for technical
computing. It has support for Gr\"obner basis and can be used for
automated theorem proving. $F = GroebnerBasis[\{poly_1\}, \{poly_2\},
  \ldots]$ computes a Gr\"obner basis for the given list of
construction polynomials. If $PolynomialReduce[poly, F, V][[2]]$ is
zero ($V$ is the set of variables), the geometry statement represented
by polynomial $poly$ is true.

\paragraph{Wu's method in Maple -- wsolve}

The implemented algorithm is based on Wu's method and his theorems
about the projection of quasi variety (\cite{quasivarieties}). While
proving geometry conjecture, weakest non--degenerate conditions can be
obtained by computing the projection of a quasi variety. In fact, it
is possible to get the sufficient and necessary condition for a
geometric theorem to be false by computing the projection of a quasi
variety.

The method is easily invoked by key word \emph{wsolve(V, P, C)} where
$V$ is a list of variables, $P$ is a list of construction polynomials
and $C$ is a statement polynomial.

\section{Alegebrization of geometric relations in solid geometry}
\label{polynomials}
To apply algebraic methods we need to be able to represent various
geometric relations between solid geometry objects using polynomial
equations over their coordinates. In this section we are going to give
examples how this could be done, for the most common relations (a
richer set of relations can be represented using similar techniques,
and a detailed description is given in an online
appendix). \marginpar{dodati url}

\subsection{Representation of basic objects -- points, lines and planes}
One of the first questions in the algebraization process is what
objects of 3d geometry are basic and can be used in our statements and
what variables are used to express geometric relations. We shall
consider two different approaches. In both approaches, each kind of
object is represented by some tuple of parameters (we shall see that
these could have either symbolic, or numeric values).

In the first approach points are the only basic objects and all other
objects are defined using only points (e.g., lines are defined by two
different points, and planes are defined as three different,
non-colinear points). For example, instead of lines, one must always
use pairs of points. For example, the fact that the point $A$ belongs
to the line $PQ$, is expressed by the relation $incident\ A\ P\ Q$.
The only variables used in polynomials are coordinates of the points.

In the second approach, all three types of objects are allowed. For
example, statements can explicitly mention lines and $incident\ A\ l$
expressed that the point $A$ belongs to the line $l$. All objects are
represented using their own parameters (e.g., a line is defined by the
coordinates of its one point, and the coordinates of its direction
vector, and a plane is defined by the coefficients of the plane
equation -- the coordinates of its normal vector, and its displacement
wrt.~the origin). Polynomials can include variables for all those
parameters.

Note that we could also allow using lines and planes in the first
approach, as a syntactic sugar. Although the user can use them in the
relations, the system internally maps all line names to pairs of
points and plane names to triple of points and encodes all relations
as polynomial equations over only the coordinates of points.

We shall describe how to encode relations using both of these
approaches, and shall compare their efficiency.

\paragraph{Points and vectors}
Points will have three parameters, representing their
coordinates. They will be denoted by superscripts $({\_}^x, {\_}^y,
{\_}^z)$. For example, point $A$ will be parametrized by the triple of
$(A^x, A^y, A^z)$. Coordinates can be either symbolic (variables or
expressions) or numeric (when the exact position of some points is
known or can be directly calculated).

For describing relations we shall use vectors. Vector determined by
two points $A = (A^x, A^y, A^z)$ and $B = (B^x, B^y, B^z)$ is
$\overrightarrow{AB} = (B^x- A^x, B^y - A^y, B^z - A^z)$. The standard
notions of scalar product, cross product and triple product can be
applied to vectors.

%% Scalar product of vectors $v = (v^x, v^y, v^z)$ and $u = (u^x, u^y,
%% u^z)$ is $v\cdot u = v^x\cdot u^x+ v^y\cdot u^y + v^z\cdot u^z$, their
%% vector product is determined by the matrix:
%% $$ v\times u = \left|\begin{array}{ccc} \overrightarrow{i} & \overrightarrow{j} & \overrightarrow{k} \\ 
%%                        v^x& v^y & v^z \\
%%                        u^x& u^y & u^z \\
%% \end{array}\right|,$$
%% and their triple product with the vector $w = (w^x, w^y, w^z)$ is
%% equal to $v\cdot (u \times w)$, and is determined by the matrix:
%% $$\left|\begin{array}{ccc} v^x& v^y & v^z \\ u^x& u^y
%%   & u^z \\ w^x& w^y & w^z \\
%% \end{array}\right|.$$

\paragraph{Lines and planes}

Representation of lines depends on approach used.

In the first approach a line is represented by two different given
points, i.e., a six-tuple of their coordinates. The first of the point
of the line $l$ will be denoted by $l_A$ and the second point by
$l_B$.

In the other approach, a line is given by a given point $A$ and a
direction vector $v$. Direction vector of the line $l$ will be denoted
by $\overrightarrow{l_v}$ and the point of the line $l$ will be
denoted by $l_A$. Therefore, lines in the second approach will also
have six parameters denoted by superscripts. For example, the line $l$
will have the parameters $(l^{v_x}, l^{v_y}, l^{v_z}, l^{A_x},
l^{A_y}, l^{A_z})$, which represent the line given by the equation:
$$x = k_l\cdot l^{v_x} + l^{A_x},\quad y = k_l\cdot l^{A_y} +
l^{A_y},\quad z = k_l\cdot l^{v_z} + l^{A_z}.$$ In the previous
equations, $k_l$ denotes the line ratio, not present in the line
specification (which is a six-tuple). Line ratio is going to be used
in some polynomials that describe constructions involving lines, and
in that case it is to be introduced as a fresh symbolic variable.

Planes are also represented differently, depending on the used
approach.

In the first approach a plane is given by three different,
non-colinear points, and a nine-tuple of their coordinates. The first
point of the plane $\pi$ will be denoted by $\pi_A$, the second one by
$\pi_B$ and the third one by $\pi_C$.

In the other approach, planes are determined by their normal vector
$v$ and an additional parameter $d$ (displacement from the
origin). Vector of the plane named $\pi$ will be denoted with
$\overrightarrow{\pi_v}$ and free parameter for the plane will be
denoted with $\pi_d$. Therefore, planes will have only four
parameters. For example, the plane $\pi$, will be represented by the
tuple $(\pi^{v_x}, \pi^{v_y}, \pi^{v_z}, \pi^{d})$ that satisfies
$$\pi^{v_x}\cdot x + \pi^{v_y}\cdot y + \pi^{v_z}\cdot z + \pi^{d} =
0.$$



\subsection{Representing relations between geometry objects}
In this section are given polynomials that arithmetically describe
relations over constructed objects (for example, two points coincide,
two lines are parallel, two planes are orthogonal).  Each kind of
relation introduces some polynomial constraints over the parameters of
the objects that are involved, and can be expressed differently
depending on the chosen approach.

Input parameters for given relation are parameters of all objects
involved in it. For example, for the relation \mbox{{\tt congruent}
  $A$ $B$ $C$ $D$} inputs are four points, $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, e.g
their symbolic or numeric parameters: $(a^x, a^y, a^z)$, $(b^x, b^y,
b^z)$, $(c^x, c^y, c^z)$ and $(d^x, d^y, d^z)$.

We start with some relations that involve only points, and therefore
are equally encoded using both approaches.

\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt congruent} $A$ $B$ $C$ $D$ --- Two
  segments, $AB$ and $CD$ are congruent.

  %{\em Input:} Points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.

{\em Polynomials:}
$\overrightarrow{AB} \cdot \overrightarrow{AB} = \overrightarrow{CD} \cdot \overrightarrow{CD}$. \\
Note that this gives the polynomial equation:

$$({a^x} - {b^x})^2 + ({a^y} - {b^y})^2 + ({a^z} - {b^z})^2 - ({c^x} - {d^x})^2 - ({c^y} - {d^y})^2 - ({c^z} - {d^z})^2 = 0$$

{\em Explanation:} Squares of the distance between $A$ and $B$ must be
equal to the square of the distance between $C$ and $D$.

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt segments\_in\_ratio} $A$ $B$ $C$ $D$
  $m$ $n$ --- the lengths of segments $AB$ and
  $CD$ are in the given ratio $\frac{m}{n}$ i.e., that
  $\frac{|AB|}{|CD|} = \frac{m}{n}$.

{\em Polynomials:} A single equation obtained from the condition
$n^2 \cdot \overrightarrow{AB} \cdot \overrightarrow{AB} = m^2 \cdot \overrightarrow{CD} \cdot \overrightarrow{CD}$.

{\em Explanation:} The squares of distances between $A$ and $B$ and
between $C$ and $D$ must be in the ratio $\frac{m^2}{n^2}$. Note that
this reduces to congruence when $m = n$.

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt is\_midpoint} $M$ $A$ $B$ --- the point
  $M$ is the midpoint of the segment determined by points $A$ and
  $B$.

{\em Polynomials:} The three polynomial equations derived from $\overrightarrow{MA} = \overrightarrow{MB}$:

\begin{tabbing}
$2m^x - a^x - b^x = 0$ \\ 
$2m^y - a^y - b^y = 0$ \\ 
$2m^z - a^z - b^z = 0$
\end{tabbing}

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt point\_segment\_ratio} $M$ $A$ $B$ $m$
  $n$ --- checks weather the point $M$ divides segment determined by
  points $A$ and $B$ in ratio determined by $m$ and $n$,
  e.g. $\frac{|MA|}{|MB|} = \frac{m}{n}$.
\marginpar{Ovo zapravo znaci da su segmenti $MA$ i $MB$ u odnosu $m$ prema $n$ -- deluje mi da je ovo visak.}

{\em Polynomials:} The three polynomial equations derived from
$n\cdot \overrightarrow{MA} = m\cdot \overrightarrow{MB}$.

{\em Explanation:} Note that {\tt is\_midpoint $M$ $A$ $B$} can be
also written using this rule as {\tt point\_segment\_ratio} $M$ $A$
$B$ $1$ $1$.

\bigskip

Next we describe some relations that involve both points and lines (if
the first approach is used, then lines are represented using pairs of
distinct points, either explicitly by the user, or implicitly, by the
system).

\marginpar{Narednih nekoliko primera pokazuju opsti sablon --- kada

  relaciju koja koristi dve tacke -- relacija sa pravom se u prvom

  kasnije preskociti da uvodimo duple varijante.}
\marginpar{Danijela: Da, slazem se. Varijata sa tackama je uvedene jer

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt incident} $A$ $P$ $Q$ --- point $A$ belongs
  to the line $P$ $Q$.

{\em Polynomials:} The three polynomials are derived from
$\overrightarrow{PQ} \times \overrightarrow{Al_A} = 0$.

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt incident} $A$ $l$ --- point $A$ belongs
  to the line $l$.

{\em Polynomials:} If the first approach is used, then this reduces to
$incident\ A\ l_A\ l_B$ described above. If the second approach is
used, then the three polynomials are derived from
$\overrightarrow{l_v} \times \overrightarrow{Al_A} = 0$.

\marginpar{Premestiti celu ovu diskusiju u gornji slucaj A P Q -- isto
  vazi tamo, samo malo formule treba prilagoditi.} Note that although
there are three polynomial equations, one can always be derived from
the other two. For example, if the second approach is used, the three
polynomials are:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  poly_1 = (A^y - l_A^y)\cdot l_v^z - (A^z - l_A^z)\cdot l_v^y = 0\\
  poly_2 = (A^z - l_A^z)\cdot l_v^x - (A^x - l_A^x)\cdot l_v^z = 0\\
  poly_3 = (A^x - l_A^x)\cdot l_v^y - (A^y - l_A^y)\cdot l_v^x = 0
\end{eqnarray*}

Then it holds that $l_v^x \cdot poly_1 + l_v^y \cdot poly_2 + l_v^z
\cdot poly_3 = 0$. If $l_v^z \neq 0$, then $poly_1 = 0$ and $poly_2 =
0$ imply that $poly_3 = 0$. However, if $l_v^z = 0$, then $poly_1 =
0$, and $poly_2 = 0$ only imply that $A^z = l_A^z$, and it need not
automatically hold that $poly_3 = 0$. Generally, one of the
coefficients $l_v^x$, $l_v^y$ and $l_v^z$ must different from zero (as
the line director vector must be nonzero) and that determines the two
equations which imply the third, but since these three coefficients
are symbollic, we always explicitly check all three equations.
\marginpar{Ovo je osnova svih onih kasnijih problema sa viskom
  jednacina}

Note that if the relation $incident\ A\ l$ occurs in the assumptions
of the theorem, then, due to the dependence of the three polynomials,
some variants of the Wu's method might have problem in the
triangulation phase (for example, GeoProver exibited this behaviour).

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt orthogonal\_lines} $A$ $B$ $C$ $D$ ---
  the line $AB$ is orthogonal on the line $CD$.

{\em Polynomials:} A polynomial derived from $\overrightarrow{AB}
\cdot \overrightarrow{CD} = 0$.

However, this conditions is not enough since it is only checked
weather the appropriate vectors of the lines are orthogonal but lines
itself could be skew. So, one more condition must be added in order to
ensure that lines really intersect: $\overrightarrow{AC} \times
(\overrightarrow{AB} \cdot \overrightarrow{CD}) = 0$

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt orthogonal\_lines} $l$ $m$ --- the lines
  $l$ and $m$ are orthogonal.

{\em Polynomials:} If the first approach is used, then the lines are
given by the points $(l_A, l_B)$ and $(l_A, l_B)$, so this reduces to
the previous case of $orthogonal\_lines\ l_A\ l_B\ m_A\ m_B$. If the
second approach is used, the direction vectors of the lines are given
as the input, and the polynomial is $\overrightarrow{l_v} \cdot
\overrightarrow{m_v} = 0$. Similarly for intersection condition,
polynomial are derived from $\overrightarrow{m_Am_B} \times
(\overrightarrow{l_v} \cdot \overrightarrow{m_v}) = 0$.

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt parallel\_lines} $p$ $q$ --- lines $p$
  and $q$ are parallel.

{\em Polynomials:} The three polynomials are derived from
$\overrightarrow{p_Ap_B} \times \overrightarrow{q_Aq_B}$ or
$\overrightarrow{p_v} \times \overrightarrow{q_v}$ depending on the
approach.

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt parallel\_planes} $\alpha$ $\beta$ ---
  planes $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are parallel.

{\em Polynomials:} If the first approach is used, polynomials are
derived from:

$$\overrightarrow{\beta_A\beta_B}\cdot \overrightarrow{\alpha_A\alpha_C} \times \overrightarrow{\alpha_B\alpha_A} = 0$$
$$\overrightarrow{\beta_A\beta_C}\cdot \overrightarrow{\alpha_A\alpha_C} \times \overrightarrow{\alpha_A\alpha_B} = 0$$

These two equations are derived from conditions that vectors of lines
in $\beta$ plane are orthogonal to the vector determine the plane
$\beta$. Since $\beta$ and $\alpha$ should be parallel, vectors of
lines in $\beta$ should be orthogonal to the vector determine plane
$\alpha$, e.g. to the $\overrightarrow{\alpha_A\alpha_C} \times
\overrightarrow{\alpha_B\alpha_A}$. However, polynomials gained from
these equations are quite complex (which we shall see is important
property for algebraic theorem provers). For example, first polynomial
is:
$$(\beta_{A^x} - \beta_{B^x})(\alpha_{A^y} - \alpha_{B^y})(\alpha_{A^z} - \alpha_{C^z}) + (\alpha_{A^x} - \alpha_{B^x})(\alpha_{A^y} - \alpha_{C^y})(\beta_{A^z} - \beta_{B^z}) +$$
$$(\beta_{A^x} - \beta_{B^y})(\alpha_{A^z} - \alpha_{B^z})(\alpha_{A^x} - \alpha_{C^x}) - (\beta_{A^z} - \beta_{B^z})(\alpha_{A^y} - \alpha_{B^y})(\alpha_{A^x} - \alpha_{C^x}) -$$
$$(\alpha_{A^z} - \alpha_{B^z})(\alpha_{A^y} - \alpha_{C^y})(\beta_{A^x} - \beta_{B^x}) - (\beta_{A^x} - \beta_{B^y})(\alpha_{A^x} - \alpha_{B^x})(\alpha_{A^z} - \alpha_{C^z}) = 0$$

If the second approach is used, the three polynomials are derived from
$\overrightarrow{\alpha_v} \times \overrightarrow{\beta_v} = 0.$
For the comparison, one of the polynomials derived using this approach is:
$$\alpha_{v^y}\beta_{v^z} - \alpha_{v^z}\beta_{v^y} = 0$$


% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt orthogonal\_planes} $\alpha$ $\beta$ ---
  checks weather two planes, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are orthogonal.

{\em Polynomials:} If the first approach is used, the polynomial is
derived from $(\overrightarrow{\alpha_A\alpha_B} \times
\overrightarrow{\alpha_A\alpha_B}) \cdot
(\overrightarrow{\beta_A\beta_B} \times
\overrightarrow{\beta_A\beta_B}) = 0$.

If the second approach is used, the polynomial is
$\overrightarrow{\alpha_v} \cdot \overrightarrow{\beta_v} = 0$.

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt point\_in\_plane} $A$ $\pi$ --- the point
  $A$ belongs to the plane $\pi$.

{\em Polynomials:} If the first approach is used, then the polynomial
$$\overrightarrow{\pi_AA}\cdot (\overrightarrow{\pi_A\pi_B} \times \overrightarrow{\pi_A\pi_C}) = 0.$$
If the second approach is used, then the polynomial
$\overrightarrow{\pi_v} \cdot \overrightarrow{A} + \pi^{d} = 0$.

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt parallel\_line\_plane} $p$ $\alpha$ ---
  line $p$ and plane $\alpha$ are parallel.

{\em Polynomials:} 
If the first approach is used, then the polynomial is
$\overrightarrow{p_Ap_B} \cdot (\overrightarrow{\alpha_A\alpha_B \times \alpha_A\alpha_C}) = 0$.
If the second approach is used, then polynomial
$\overrightarrow{p_v} \cdot \overrightarrow{\alpha_v} = 0$.

{\em Note:} This statement also holds if line belongs to the plane.

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt orthogonal\_line\_plane} $p$ $\alpha$ ---
  the line $p$ and plane $\alpha$ are orthogonal.

{\em Polynomials:} If the first approach is used polynomials are
derived from $\overrightarrow{p_Ap_B} \cdot
\overrightarrow{\alpha_A\alpha_B} = 0$ and $\overrightarrow{p_Ap_B}
\cdot \overrightarrow{\alpha_A\alpha_C} = 0$.

If the second approach is used the three polynomials
$\overrightarrow{p_v} \times \overrightarrow{\alpha_v} = 0$.

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt line\_in\_plane} $l$ $\alpha$ --- the $l$
  is in the plane $\alpha$.


{\em Polynomials:} If the first approach is used polynomials are
derived from two conditions {\tt point\_in\_plane} $l_A$ $\pi$ and
{\tt point\_in\_plane} $l_B$ $\pi$.

If the second approach is used, polynomials are derived from {\tt
  point\_in\_plane} $l_A$ $\pi$ and {\tt orthogonal\_line\_plane} $l$
$\alpha$.

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt equal\_angles} $A$ $O_1$ $B$ $C$ $O_2$ $D$ --- angles $\angle AO_1B$ and $\angle
CO_2D$ are equal.

{\em Polynomials:} Polynomials for this condition could be derived
using trigonometry condition:
$$\cos{\angle AO_1B} = \cos{\angle CO_2D}$$

and cosine of an angle can be determined using following equation:
$$\cos{\angle AO_1B} = \frac{\overrightarrow{AO_1}\cdot
  \overrightarrow{BO_1}}{2|AO_1||BO_1|}.$$

Polynomial equation for $\cos{\angle CO_2D}$ is similar. However,
distance ($|AO_1|$ and $|BO_1|$) is determined using square root and
polynomials for algebraic theorem provers cannot have square
roots. Thus, squares of the cosines of an angles must be compared ---
$\cos^2{\angle AO_1B} = \cos^2{\angle CO_2D}$. Unfortunately, this
makes the condition weakened since squares of cosines of accute and
obtuse angle could be same although angles itself are not
equal. Finally, using several algebraic equations polynomial is
derived from
$$(\overrightarrow{AO_1}\cdot  \overrightarrow{BO_1})^2|CO_2|^2|DO_2|^2 = (\overrightarrow{CO_2}\cdot  \overrightarrow{DO_2})^2|AO_1|^2|BO_1|^2.$$

The polynomial derived from this equation is quite complex and
challenging for algebraic theorem provers and in the following chapter
we shall see how it can be dissembled onto more simpler ones.

\section{Construction rules}
Each construction starts from some given (free) objects and proceeds
by introducing new (dependent) objects. We will allow introducing only
free points (and all lines, planes, and solids are going to be
constructed started from a given set of free points).

Free points are determined by their fresh, symbolic coordinates, and
are not restricted by any polynomials. Constructed objects are
determined again by introducing their fresh symbolic parameters, but
also polynomials that describe connections between those parameters
and the symbolic parameters of the objects that were previously
constructed. We shall denote the parameters of free points by
upper-case letters, and the parameters of dependent points by
lower-case letters. For example, the free point $A$ will have symbolic
coordinates $({A}^x, {A}^y, {A}^z)$, and a constructed line $l$ will
have symbolic parameters (${l}^{v_x}, {l}^{v_y}, {l}^{v_z}, {l}^{p_x},
{l}^{p_y}, {l}^{p_z}$).

Construction steps correspond to functions of the form $o = f(i_1,
\ldots, i_n)$, where $o$ is the constructed (output) object and $i_1$,
\ldots, $i_n$ are the input objects (either free or dependent,
described by either numeric or symbolic parameters). In most cases the
algebraization introduces new fresh parameters for the object $o$, and
then constructs the polynomials based on the relation $R(i_1, \ldots,
i_n, o)$, where $R$ is the relation corresponding to the function $f$.
For example, constructing the midpoint $m = midpoint\ A\ B$, reduces
to introducing variables $m_x$ and $m_y$ and constructing polynomials
from the condition $is\_midpoint\ m\ A\ B$. However, in some
construction steps we can introduce less parameters, and we describe
those cases. Also, some symbolic variables for free points could be
substituted with numeric values and we described this procedure in
simplification of polynomials (Section \ref{simplification}).

\paragraph{Constructions of points}

Its name will be given by the first argument of the construction step
(e.g., {\tt midpoint} $M$ $A$ $B$ constructs the point $M$ using given
points $A$ $B$). In each such construction step, it is assumed that
the numeric or symbolic parameters of given objects are already known,
and the symbolic coordinates of the resulting point are introduced (as
fresh variables).

\begin{description}

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt point} $A$ --- introduces a free point
  $A$.  with the three fresh parameters $(A_x, A_y, A_z)$

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt intersection\_lines} $A$ $P$ $Q$ $M$ $N$
  --- point $A$ is the intersection of lines $PQ$ and $MN$.

{\em Polynomials:} Six polynomials are derived from the conditions
$incident\ A\ l_1$ and $incident\ A\ l_2$.

Note again that the first three and the second three polynomials are
dependent, so Wu's method might again have problems triangulating the
system, and in those cases two out of six polynomials must be
excluded. However, it is not always trivial to determine which two of
the six polynomials should be excluded. For example, it can happen
(due to choice of the coordinates of the free points) that some
variables are omitted in some polynomial equations due to
multiplication with zero. So, in order to make triangular system,
careful analysis must be taken in order to choose which polynomials
could be omitted.

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt intersection\_lines} $A$ $l_1$ $l_2$ ---
  point $A$ is the intersection of lines $l_1$ and $l_2$.

  {\em Polynomials:} If the first approach is used then this reduces
  to $incident\ A\ l_A\ l_B\ m_A\ m_B$. If the second approach is
  used, six polynomials are derived from the conditions
  $incident\ A\ l_1$ and $incident\ A\ l_2$.


% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt intersection\_line\_plane} $A$ $l$ $\pi$ ---
  point $A$ is the intersection of line $l$ and plane $\pi$.

  {\em Polynomials} are derived from {\tt incident $A$ $l$} and {\tt
    incident $A$ $\pi$}.

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt make\_point\_on\_line} $A$ $l$ ---
  construct a point $A$ that belongs to the line $l$.
  
  {\em Input:} Line $l$ with parameters with parameters $l_A$ and
  $l_B$ for the first approach or with symbolic parameters $l(l^{v_x},
  l^{v_y}, l^{v_z}, l^{p_x}, l^{p_y}, l^{p_z})$ for the second
  approach.

  {\em Objects and parameters:} Point $A(a^x, a^y, a^z)$, for three
  fresh parameters $a^x$, $a^y$ and $a^z$. {\em Polynomials} are
  derived from {\tt incident $A$ $l$}.

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt make\_point\_in\_plane} $A$ $\pi$ ---
  construct a point $A$ that belongs to the plane $\pi$.
  
  {\em Input:} Plane $\pi$ with parameters $\pi_A$, $\pi_B$ and
  $\pi_C$ for the first approach or $(\pi^{v_x}, \pi^{v_y}, \pi^{v_z},
  \pi^{d})$ for the second approach.

  {\em Objects and parameters:} Point $A(a^x, a^y, a^z)$, for three
  fresh parameters $a^x$, $a^y$ and $a^z$. {\em Polynomial} are
  derived from {\tt incident $A$ $\pi$}.

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt translate\_z} $A$ $O$ $q$ --- construct a point by translating point $A$
  by some parameter along $z$-axis.
  
  {\em Input:} Point $O$ with symbolic coordinates $(o^x, o^y, o^z)$
  and parameter $q$.

  {\em Objects and parameters:} Point $A(o^x, o^y, a^z)$, for one
  fresh parameter, $a^z$. {\em Polynomial} is derived from
  $\overrightarrow{AO} = (0, 0, q)$.
\end{description}


\paragraph{Constructions of lines}
Although the construction of a free line could be easily introduced,
for simplicity, we have chosen to support only free points (and a free
line can be constructed as a line trough two free points).

\begin{description}
% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt line\_points} $l$ $A$ $B$ --- for two
  given points $A$ and $B$ determines the line $l$ that goes through
  these points.

  {\em Input:} Two points $A$ and $B$ with symbolic coordinates $(a^x,
  a^y, a^z)$ and $(b^x, b^y, b^z)$.

  In the first approach, there are no new polynomials and it just
  denoted that line $l$ is determined with points $A$ and $B$.

  In the second approach are introduced the line $l$ with parameters
  $(l^{v_x}, l^{v_y}, l^{v_z}, a^x, a^y, a^z)$ (new, fresh parameters
  $(l^{v_x}, l^{v_y}, l^{v_z})$ are parameters of line vector). As it
  can be noted, parameters for a point belonging the line are
  parameters of point $A$. There were no need to introduce new
  parameters and we can arbitrary choose between points $A$ and
  $B$. Polynomials are derived from {\tt incident $A$ $l$} and {\tt
    incident $A$ $l$}.

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt line\_orth\_plane} $l$ $\pi$ $A$ -- for a
  given plane $\pi$ and a point $A$ determines line $l$ witch is
  orhogonal on the given plane $\pi$ and incides with the point $A$.

{\em Input:} Plane $\pi$ with symbolic parameters $(\pi^{v_x},
\pi^{v_y}, \pi^{v_z}, \pi^{d})$ and point $A$ with symbolic
coordinates $(a^x, a^y, a^z)$.

{\em Objects and parameters:} If the first approach is used then first
point determining the line is point $A$ and the second point is $A +
\overrightarrow{\pi}$ where $\overrightarrow{\pi}$ is determined with
$\overrightarrow{\pi_A\pi_B} \times \overrightarrow{\pi_A\pi_C}$.

If the second approach is used line $l$
is determined with parameters $(\pi^{v_x}, \pi^{v_y}, \pi^{v_z},
\pi^{d}, a^x, a^y, a^z)$ (no new parameters are generated).
\end{description}

The construction of the line trough a given point that is parallel to
the given line is performed similarly (the parameters of the point and
the parameters of the vector of the given line can be reused, and no
new parameters and polynomials need to be introduced).


\paragraph{Constructions of the plane}
Again, for simplicity, we have chosen to support only free points (and
a free plane can be constructed as a plane trough three free points).

\begin{description}
% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt plane\_points} $\pi$ $A$ $B$ $C$ --- for
  three given points $A$, $B$ and $C$ determines the plane $\pi$
  containing all of them.

{\em Input:} Tree point $A$, $B$ and $C$ with symbolic coordinates
$(a^x, a^y, a^z)$, $(b^x, b^y, b^z)$ and $(c^x, c^y, c^z)$.

If the first approach is used then there are no new polynomials since
it is just noted in the system that plane $\pi$ is determined with
points $A$, $B$ and $C$.

If the second approach is used then plane $\pi$ is determined with
fresh parameters $(\pi^{v_x}, \pi^{v_y}, \pi^{v_z}, \pi^{d})$ and
there are new polynomials connecting these fresh parameters with
symbolic coordinates of the points. Polynomials are derived from
$\overrightarrow{\pi} = \overrightarrow{AB} \times
\overrightarrow{AC}$ and {\tt incident $\pi$ $A$}.
\end{description}

Very similar methods can be used to construct the plane that contains
the given line and is orthogonal or is parallel to the given plane.

\paragraph{Solid construction}
\label{objectconstruction}

Problems in solid geometry usually deal with objects and usually start
with a sentence of the form {\em "In a given cube..."}, {\em "In a
  given pyramid..."}, {\em "In a given prism..."} and so on. The first
approach was to construct such solids using construction rules
presented above. This means that there were many rules (around 20)
constructing only one cube and thus many new variables and polynomials
which made polynomial systems very complex. Also, some important
construction steps could be forgotten. Therefore, it is very natural
to introduce solid constructions as elementary construction steps
(instead of ten or twenty rules that construct their points, lines and
planes). Such construction steps automatically introduce only the
points of the solid, whereas lines (edges) and planes (faces) can be
introduced by the previous construction rules only when necessary.

We decide to support only the construction of solids placed in some
{\em canonical} positions --- for example, when constructing a cube,
one vertex is placed in the origin, and the other three are placed on
the axes ($x$-axis, $y$-axis and $z$-axis). However, this approach has
a drawback. For example, it is not possible to construct more than one
different cube using the elementary cube construction step. The points
of other cubes that are not in the canonical position can be
constructed using point construction steps or by applying isometric
transformations to the canonical cube. On the other hand, in most
geometric problems encountered in education there is usually only one
free solid, and without loss of generality it can be assumed that it
is in the canonical position. When other solids are introduced in the
problem text, they are usually dependent, so their points (vertices)
have to be constructed. Therefore, supporting only canonical solid
constructions was not the obstacle for the problems encountered in
most exercises.

\begin{description}
% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt make\_cube} $A$ $B$ $C$ $D$ $A_1$ $B_1$
  $C_1$ $D_1$ --- construct the cube in the canonical position, with
  the edge length equal to $1$.\\
  {\em Objects and parameters:} Points $A(0, 0, 0)$, $B(1, 0, 0)$,
  $C(1, 1, 0)$, $D(0, 1, 0)$, $A_1(0, 0, 1)$, $B_1(1, 0, 1)$,
  $C_1(1, 1, 1)$ and $D(0, 1, 1)$.\\
  {\em Explanation:} No polynomials are generated. Since the cube is
  in the canonical position, no symbolic variables are introduced.

% ------------------------
\item[$\triangleright$] {\tt make\_tetrahedron} $A$ $B$ $C$

  {\em Objects and parameters:} The vertices of the tetrahedron have
  the coordinates $A(0, 0, 0)$, $B(1, 0, 0)$, $C(c^x, c^y, 0)$ and
  $D(c^x, d^y, d^z)$, with the four fresh parameters.

either symbolic or integer parameters and polynomials must always have

\section{Simplification of polynomials}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\label{simplification}

In order to test proposed algebraization we used three tools,
GeoProver, Maple and Mathematica. The first problem we encountered was
often reaching time and space limit due to complexity of polynomial
sets. The reason for this is large number of variables and polynomials
that were created. It should be noted that polynomials in solid
geometry are more complex than corresponding polynomials in plane
geometry. Thus, there was a need to simplify our system.

We used approach proposed by Harrison, without lost of generality
reasoning --- "wlog" (\cite{harrison}) by making a convenient choice
of coordinate system since different choice of coordinate system could
make algebraic calculations much less robust.

For three independently given points $A$, $B$ and $C$, it is possible
to choose their coordinated in such a manner that $A(0, 0, 0)$ is in
the origin, $B(0, 0, b^z)$ is on the $z$-axis and $C(0, c^y, c^z)$
lies in plane $yOz$. With this choice of coordinates, the number of
variables is reduced by six and the corresponding zeroes simplify
polynomials. This approach is commonly used in algebraic methods. It
does not affect the generality of statement and justification for its
usage comes from the fact that rotations and translations can be used
to transform points into its "canonical" position. Translation and
rotation are isometries which means that they preserve distance, and
then also the other geometric relations such as incidence,
orthogonality, size of an angle and so on.

Without applying this method, even the simplest statements could not
be proved. Choosing convenient coordinates greatly improved simplicity
of the system of polynomials and, by doing so, made the program more
efficient. However, some polynomials become redundant, as they become
$0$ and we just deleted them from the system. Also, some polynomials
become a polynomial of one variable on some degree and they were also
deleted from the system and the value of the corresponding variable
was set to zero. Although, it was not necessary to delete these
polynomials, the system was simplified a bit more when they were
deleted. Besides, GeoProver cannot transform polynomial system
containing $0 = 0$ into triangular system.

To simplify constructions even further, we choose appropriate
coordinates for figures as we explained in \ref{objectconstruction}.

Furthermore, polynomials whose structure is $x_i - x_j$ or $x_i + x_j$
(assume $j < i$) were also deleted from the system, each appearance of
$x_i$ was replaced with $x_j$, e.g. with $-x_j$, and $x_i$ was deleted
from the set of variables. This simplification step was not very
crucial, and most of the tested statements could be proved without
adding this simplification. However, for some complex statements, it
was very important to reduce the size of sets of polynomials
(otherwise, space or time limit is reached) and this is a step into
that direction.

Relation {\tt equal\_angles} produces very complex polynomial. Non of
the three algebraic provers (GeoProver, Maple or Mathematica) were
successful proving geometry conjecture with this relation. GeoProver
arrived to the memory limit after couple of steps, whereas Mathematica
and Maple worked for couple of hours without reaching conclusion (and
were violently interrupted). The solution was to dismantle large
polynomial into simpler ones: \\
$scalar_1 = \overrightarrow{AO}\cdot\overrightarrow{BO}$ \\
$scalar_2 = \overrightarrow{CK}\cdot\overrightarrow{DK}$ \\
$dist_{CK} = |CK|$ \\
$dist_{DK} = |DK|$ \\
$dist_{AO} = |AO|$ \\
$dist_{BO} = |BO|$ \\
$poly = scalar_1 * scalar_1 * dist_{CK} * dist_{DK} - scalar_2 * scalar_2 * dist_{AO} * dist_{BO}$ \\

Basically, the set of polynomials and variables are increased but
substituted polynomials are far less complex. With this change, non of
the three algebraic provers had problems and they reached conclusions
within a second.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Examples and testing}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section we are going to present results of testing
algebraization methods using three different provers --- GeoProver,
Maple's Wu's method and Mathematica's Gr\"obner basis method. We
applied these methods on 38 different problems from various source
(\cite{janicic1997zbirka, shao2016challenging, arhzbirka, kinknjiga}).

\begin{example}[Regular tetrahedron altitudes] 
Let $ABCS$ be a tetrahedron and let $h_a$, $h_b$, $h_c$ and $h_s$ be
perpendicular lines from vertices $A$, $B$, $C$ and $S$ onto
appropriate opposite sides. Let $H$ be intersection of lines $h_a$ and
$h_b$. Prove that $H$ is also incident with lines $h_s$ and $h_c$.

\>equal\_points $H_1$ $H_2$ \\
\>equal\_points $H_1$ $H_3$ \\
\end{tabbing}
}
\end{footnotesize}

Since tetrahedron is already in canonical position, coordinates of the
points are $A(0, 0, 0)$, $B(0, 0, 1)$, $C(x_1, x_2, 0)$ and $S(x_3,
x_4, x_5)$ where $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$ and $x_5$ are dependent
variables occur in polynomials describing tetrahedron
\ref{tetrahedron}).

Using first approach for algebraization gives $34$ polynomials
describing premises, $6$ polynomials for the conclusion (for each
algebraic method should be invoked) and $33$ variables. After
simplification procedure, the numbers of polynomials and variables are
decreased -- $22$ polynomial of premises, $9$ conclusion polynomials
and $25$ variables. It may seem odd that number of conclusion
polynomials increased, but that it due to intersection of lines
\ref{}. All three systems successfully proved statement (proved that
all $9$ polynomials are zero) and average time for GeoProver was
$0.1132$ секунде.

Second approach of algebraization and simplification procedure
produces $29$ polynomials defining premises, $9$ conclusion
polynomials and $29$ variables. Retrieved polynomials are less complex
and usually have only two monomials. All three provers were
successful, but average time was smaller, for GeoProver it was
$0.0862$ seconds.

$K$, $L$, $M$ be the middle points of edges $AB$, $BC$, $CA$

\end{footnotesize}

As in the previous example, tetrahedron is in the canonical position
by the construction, so coordinates of the points are $A(0, 0, 0)$,
$B(0, 0, 1)$, $C(x_1, x_2, 0)$ and $S(x_3, x_4, x_5)$ where $x_1$,
$x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$ and $x_5$ are dependent variables and occur in
polynomials describing tetrahedron (\ref{tetrahedron}).

By using first approach are obtained $18$ different variables, $24$
polynomials defining premises, $4$ polynomials defining conclusion of
the geometry conjecture. Obtained polynomials are bit more complex
than in a previous example. Maple and Mathematica were successful, but
GeoProver reached memory limit after $0.481$ seconds (e.g. Space limit
exceeded in pseudo division. Obtained polynomial with 3339 terms).

By using second approach, number of obtained polynomials are equal as
above, $24$, but polynomials are less complex. All three provers were
successful and GeoProver reached conclusion after $0.835$ seconds.

\begin{table}[!hb]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{L{2cm}||R{2cm}|R{2cm}|R{2cm}|R{1.5cm}}

\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of two algebraization approaches}
\end{center}
\end{table}
\end{example}

Observing these two simple examples leads to the conclusion that first
approach generates less variables, but the second approach generates
less complex polynomials. As we shall see by testing, algebraic
theorem provers are more efficient if the polynomials are simpler, and
so algebraic provers were more successful when second approach is
used.

\paragraph{Results of testing algebraic provers}
Maple and Mathematica were more successful than GeoProver. Mathematica
and Maple were tested over $38$ problems using first approach. Both
systems were successful for $28$ problems (physically interrupted
after $5$ minutes of not reaching conclusion). If the second approach
is used, bot provers were successful for $36$ problems. For two
problems, provers did not reach conclusion within two hours. The
complexity of polynomials for both problems was large.

GeoProver was also more successful when second approach is
used. However, this system more often failed due to different
problems: time limit reached, space limit reached and general error
occured. General error occured when the polynomial system could not be
transformed into triangular system and it is, in our view, very
complex to avoid this problem by analyzing polynomials and deleting
redundant ones.

\section{Non--degeneracy conditions}


Algebraic theorem provers does not only prove geometry statement, they
also produce conditions under which this statement is true. These
conditions are called non--degeneracy or NDG conditions. In simple
Wu's method, once decomposition $cg_j = \sum_{i=1}^{k}h_if_i + r$ is
obtained, if $c(v_1, \ldots, v_n) \neq 0$ holds and $\bigwedge_{i =
  1}^{k} f_i(v_1, \ldots, v_n) = 0 \Longrightarrow g_j(v_1, \ldots,
v_n) = 0$ holds then geometry statement holds, too. This means that
geometry conjecture is true only for those objects whose coordinates
satisfy condition $c(v_1, \ldots, v_n) \neq 0$.  

However NDG conditions are given in algebraic terms, but in the
context of geometry theorem proving, it is important to have their
geometrical interpretation as well. Extensive research has been done
to transform algebraic NDG conditions into geometric ones for planar
geometry (\cite{chou1988mechanical}). It is noted that it can happen
that statement is true even under weaker assumptions and that some
conditions are not necessary. In addition, a presence of NDG
conditions doesn’t necessarily mean that if they are not satisfied the
conjecture is invalid.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no research how gained NDG
conditions could be transformed into geometric terms for three
dimensional geometry. We did not investigate automatic approach for
transforming NDG conditions but we analyze gained conditions with
pen-and-paper. Couple interesting examples are given below.

\begin{example}[Two examples from previous section]
For both examples from previous section are gained same NDG
condition. It is expressed with $x_7 \neq 0$. For both examples this
variable belongs to the plane determined with points $A$, $B$ and
$C$. Vector of this line is $(x_5, x_6, x_7)$. However, due to
simplification, points $A$, $B$ and $C$ have some canonical
coordinates --- $A(0, 0, 0)$, $B(0, 0, b^z)$ and $C(0, c^y,
c^z)$. These coordinates determine vector of the plane $ABC$ such that
$x_5 = 0$ and $x_6 = 0$. So, this conditions $x_7 \neq 0$ enables that
plane is well defined.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Example from (\cite{arhzbirka})] 
Let $ABCDA_1B_1C_1D_1$ be a cube and let $S$ be the vertex of regular
four side pyramid $ABCDS$ whose height is twice the size of the side
of the cube. Prove that regular four side pyramid gained in the
intersection of pyramid $ABCDS$ and cube $ABCDA_1B_1C_1D_1$ has base
side twice the smaller than the size of the side of the cube.

}
\end{footnotesize}

Algebraic theorem provers proved this geometry conjecture. Derived NDG
condition is $x_{21} \cdot x_{15} \cdot x_{13} + x_{20} \cdot x_{14}
\cdot x_{13} + x_{19} \cdot x_{13}^2 \neq 0$. This condition can be
dismantled into two conditions $x_{13} \neq 0$ and $x_{21} \cdot
x_{15} + x_{20} \cdot x_{14} + x_{19} \cdot x_{13} \neq 0$. Now it had
to be determined what geometry objects these variables determine and
it happens to be line $l(x_{13}, x_{14}, x_{15})$ and plane
$\alpha(x_{19}, x_{20}, x_{21}, x_{22})$.

The second NDG condition ensures that line $l$ and plane $\alpha$
are not parallel. If they were to be parallel, they would not
intersect and there would be no point $L$. 
\end{example}

\section{Conclusion and future work}

To the best of our knowledge there does not exist automated theorem
prover for solid geometry. Automated methods (such as Wu's method or
Gr\"obner basis method) can prove solid geometry statements, but using
these methods requires transforming geometry statements into
polynomial equations.

We studied two different algebraization methods for geometry
statements. The first approach introduces only coordinates of the
points involved in the construction, whereas the second approach
introduces coordinates of the objects involved in the geometry
statements such as lines, planes and objects. By comparing these two
approaches on the same set of problems, we concluded that algebraic
provers are more efficient if their input is obtained using second
approach. While testing, we noticed that the significant property is
the complexity of the polynomials in the set. The simpler polynomials
leads to better efficiency. It is especially important (if possible)
to avoid quadratic polynomials --- better approach is to substitute
complex quadratic polynomial with two or more simpler ones. Though the
smaller number of polynomials and the smaller number of variables also
help in better productivity, these two properties are not the key ones
and their impact is less obvious. Using second approach, obtained
polynomials are less complex and that is the reason why the second
approach was more convenient for algebraic provers.

During this research, we also examined different implementations of
algebraic provers. GeoProver's Wu's method required to be possible to
transform polynomials in the premises into triangular system. However,
this property is hard to secure and special care should be taken for
intersection of two lines. Thus, we felt more comfortable using the
other two provers, Maple's Wu's method and Mathematica's Gr\"oebner
basis method.
