\begin{itemize}
\item Use left text field to write geometry problem. (see
  \url{http://poincare.matf.bg.ac.rs/~danijela/publications/solids_apendix.pdf})

\item Press button {\em Make polynomials}.

\item In the right text field will be written derived polynomials
  before and after simplification is preformed.

\item See results using {\em Results} drop--down menu.

\item There are three possible results: for Maple, for Mathematica,
  for GeoProver. Choose one.

\item In the right text field will be open chosen result. Copy+Paste
  in appropriate program and press Enter. 

\item It can happen (for some geometry statements) that there are more
  than one file. In order to prove statement open each file and for
  each file run appropriate program.

\item Under {\em File} drop--down manu there are {\em Save} and {\em
  Open} menus (use them as always).

\item Under {\em File} drop--down manu there are {\em Examples}. Click
  to open folder with examples. Some examples are quite simple (see
  examples23.txt, examples24.txt) and some examples are quite complex
  (see examples28.txt, examples29.txt, examples31.txt).

\item Have fun!
